# CRAZY RUN

This is a simple infinite runner game that has five difficuly levels. This is the first game that I have developed, as a project in my college.

## Gameplay ##
There would be character which keeps running forward and has to dodge the obstacles which are on his way by moving left or right, jumping or by finding the path which is free and safe. The longer the time character stays alive the more the points he earn.
